**Assignment 2**

The output files were generated using 5 processes in a 2*2 grid, with 5 iterations at the base station and threshold of 6000.

Meanwhile, each node would also generate their own file node_X.txt for debugging purposes.

*Identation in text files were adjusted according to Oracle VB's Pluma software, thus the identation and spacing may differ when opening the text files on other software.
